## Workshop Desciption

In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), with the rapid development of advanced sensing, data storage, data analytics, and high-performance computing technologies, both manufacturing industries and healthcare systems are experiencing a data‑driven revolution. However, the unique characteristics of manufacturing and healthcare systems prevent the direct application of existing data-driven methods. Their characteristics include (1) systematic physical principles, (2) high demand for interpretability, robustness, and trustworthiness, and (3) limited computation resources and the need for instant decision-making. These characteristics raised pressing needs to develop domain-aware data-driven approaches for critical tasks in manufacturing and healthcare systems, such as smart diagnosis, automatic control, design optimization, customized analytics, etc.

This workshop aims to demonstrate the recent research progress of data science, which focuses on addressing the unique challenges in manufacturing and healthcare systems, such as the gaps in data quality/security assurance, domain-aware data analytics, improvement of trustworthiness, etc. We cordially invite submissions that focus on recent advances in research/development of data science, which are motivated by real-world problems in manufacturing and healthcare. Papers and/or posters focus on both theoretical foundations and applications are welcomed from the areas including but not limited to:
