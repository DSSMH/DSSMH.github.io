## Workshop Desciption

In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), with the rapid development of advanced sensing, data storage, data analytics, and high-performance computing technologies, both manufacturing industries and healthcare systems are experiencing a data‑driven revolution. However, the unique characteristics of manufacturing and healthcare systems prevent the direct application of existing data-driven methods. Their characteristics include (1) systematic physical principles, (2) high demand for interpretability, robustness, and trustworthiness, and (3) limited computation resources and the need for instant decision-making. These characteristics raised pressing needs to develop domain-aware data-driven approaches for critical tasks in manufacturing and healthcare systems, such as smart diagnosis, automatic control, design optimization, customized analytics, etc.

This workshop aims to demonstrate the recent research progress of data science, which focuses on addressing the unique challenges in manufacturing and healthcare systems, such as the gaps in data quality/security assurance, domain-aware data analytics, improvement of trustworthiness, etc. We cordially invite submissions that focus on recent advances in research/development of data science, which are motivated by real-world problems in manufacturing and healthcare. Papers and/or posters focus on both theoretical foundations and applications are welcomed from the areas including but not limited to:

## Speakers
The workshop organizers will select and invite the keynote speakers. The organizers plan to invite 4-5 keynote speakers and will ensure a balanced distribution of those coming from industry and academia. Each keynote will be presented as a lecture with slides, and there will be a short Q&A session at the end of each keynote. 

The submitted papers will undergo the standard double-blind peer-review process. The workshop organizers will invite experienced program committee (PC) members for this workshop to first guarantee each paper submission will be reviewed by at least two PC members and second to ensure an informed and fair evaluation of the work being submitted. Based upon the reviews provided by PC members, the final recommendation of acceptance or rejection of the workshop will be made. The detailed review comments and notification letter will be sent to the authors accordingly, along with detailed information on whether they have been accepted for an oral presentation.

In addition, the workshop organizers will also invite judges from PC for the selection of best paper award. The results will be announced in the workshop award ceremony (as noted above in the tentative workshop schedule).

**Target audience**: This workshop is expected to invite leading researchers in the domain of data mining, machine learning, advanced manufacturing, and healthcare systems. The target audience will be program officers from funding agencies, industries, researchers who are interested in data science and its applications, and undergraduate/graduate students in the general engineering discipline who plan to pursue a career related to data science.
