### Length of the workshop:

This workshop is expected to be a full-day event with two half-day sessions, split by a lunch break.


### Target audience:

This workshop is expected to invite leading researchers in the domain of data mining, machine learning, advanced manufacturing, and healthcare systems. The target audience will be program officers from funding agencies, industries, researchers who are interested in data science and its applications, and undergraduate/graduate students in general engineering discipline who plan to pursue a career related to data science.

### Selection process

The workshop organizers will select and invite the keynote speakers. The organizers plan to invite 4-6 keynote speakers, and will ensure a balanced distribution of those coming from industry and academia. Each keynote will be presented as a lecture with slides and there will be a short Q/A session at the end of each keynote. 

The submitted papers will undergo the standard double-blind peer-review process. The workshop organizers will invite experienced program committee (PC) members for this workshop to first guarantee each paper submission will be reviewed by at least two PC members and second to ensure an informed and fair evaluation of the work being submitted. Based upon the reviews provided by PC members, the final recommendation of acceptance or rejection to the workshop will be made. The detailed review comments and notification letter will be sent to the authors accordingly along with detailed information as to whether they have been accepted for an oral or poster presentation (as noted above in the tentative workshop schedule). 

To participate in the poster session, the participants can also submit their poster abstracts to the workshop, and present their research posters in the workshop. If the number of submissions exceed the capacity, the workshop organizers will select the abstracts that have higher relevance to the workshop scope for poster presentation. 

In addition, the workshop organizers will also invite judges from PC for the selection of best paper award and best poster award. The results will be announced in the workshop award ceremony (as noted above in the tentative workshop schedule).
